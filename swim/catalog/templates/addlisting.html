  If you swim in open water somewhere not listed here, why not add it to the database?
  In the description, please think about whether the location is suitable for distance/triathlon training or more just for paddling or a cooling dip.
  If the toilets/cafe are a short walk away or not in an obvious location, please add this to the description. On the next page you will have an option to add a photo. </p>
