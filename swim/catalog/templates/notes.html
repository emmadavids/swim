psuedo code for index page

create a set of all photo objects associated with swimspot objects, ([image1, image2], [image3, image4, image5]) for example
sort by same order that swimspot objects are sorted so each list of imgs corresponds with the swimspot they are from
use template to use [0] of each list unless list is empty.set an image that can be used as default

or create a set that merges them both on the views side
