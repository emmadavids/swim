# swim
An Open Water Swimming database
Users can upload information about different locations to swim in open water. Bathing quality for different locations is automatically updated by
making calls to the UK gov environment agency API. Made with Django.

DEMO is sadly currently under construction whilst I figure out a free alternative to heroku!
